#### Recording workflow

1. Plan! Get the code ready and replicate it at least once without any issues
1. Consider having folders/branches with the various stages of your code, so that you can refer to diffs as your record
1. Record video using something like screenflow - use 720p resolution while recording
1. When you make a mistake, flash a red image or something else that is very easy to recognise, and go back to where you need to, then retry
1. Edit video mistakes out
1. Go through video and write up a script of audio that should go with the video
1. Record audio
1. When you make a mistake, clap/click loudly to make a distinct shape on the wave form, and start from the beginning of the sentence where you made a mistake. DO NOT start in the middle of a sentence, the audio will sound clunky
1. Edit the audio to remove mistakes - DO NOT try to sync audio with video before cleaning out mistakes
1. Sync up the audio and video
1. Ensure audio levels are correct, a good guideline is that peaks should be between -9 to -6 dB
1. Ensure that you have the levelled out audio in your video editor
1. Produce clips -  Frame rate: 15, Datarate: 700, Codec: single pass x264, keyframe rate: automatic, Audio sample rate: 44.1 KHz, Audio data rate: 128 kbits
